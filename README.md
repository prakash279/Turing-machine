# Theory of Computation
When we were taught TOC, for the group activity we were given the topic of 1's complement, how to find it and solve a problem for it, it was so basic i created a front end program for it

## You need to enter the value of bits you want in the tape to find the one's complement

## The system loads the tape

## The arrow simulates around the each bit and performs the one's complement and the following is the final outcome

## This is the turing machine for the program or the problem we are adressing

A very simple yet fun thing I created a year ago.
